    -   display:none

        1. removes from the DOM.
        2. Effects other elements.

    -   visibility:hidden

        1. will only hide the element will be visible in DOM.
        2. Doesn't effect other elements.

    -   repaint
    -   render tree
        -   When the DOM tree and CSSOM tree are combined.
